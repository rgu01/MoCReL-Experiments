# Experiments for paper "Synthesis and Compacting of Strategies for Multi-Agent Systems" - TACAS2022

# Hardware and OS requirement
- The experiments that are reported in the paper were conducted on a server with 48 CPU, 258G memory, running Ubuntu 20.04.

# Experiments design
- The models are seperated into 6 groups. 
- Groups A-E are for showing the performance of MoCReL dealing with different numbers of agents, tasks, milestones, and fixed/flexible task execution time.
- Group Runs is for showing how the number of runs used by the learning algorithm can influence the quality of the synthesized strategies, i.e., the probabilities of satisfying the liveness property.

# Run the experiments
- One can repeat the experiments on his/her own laptop (must be Linux) by running the *.sh files.
